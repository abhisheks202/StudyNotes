Containerize the application in local Desktop
-----------------------------------------------

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. Clone the microservice codebase which you want to try out on Docker and Kubernetes.
3. Create Dockerfile inside the project folder.
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble
an image. When we tell Docker to build our image by executing the docker build command, Docker reads these instructions
and execute them consecutively and create a Docker image as a result.
4. Update the codebase with Dockerfile and add pip folder for setup.
5. For creating image please run the below command from inside the project foler.
docker build --tag <imagename:version>
6. To check the images that are build so far use below command.
docker images
7. To run the docker image use below command
docker run -d -p <portnumber>:<portnumber> <imagename>
8. To verify the process running use below command
docker ps  #it shows all running processes
docker ps -a #it shows all processes
